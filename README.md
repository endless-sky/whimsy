# Whimsy Game Engine
Whimsy is an engine for simple point-and-click adventure games, designed to be as simple as possible while still allowing interesting game mechanics. The data file format is strongly influenced by [bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy), but using 2D sprites instead of 1-bit pixel art.

For details on how to create your own games using the engine, see the [Creator's Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1buquuf34mD3DgBbVRbZym7WhcMWwF3gICYbeq46epFY). There is also a proof-of-concept [game](https://zahni.itch.io/woodlands) that you can play in the browser on itch.io; that game's source code is included in this repository.
